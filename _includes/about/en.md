Hi，I'm Tony-Btian (翰宝), currently a graduate student at the University of Glasgow.

As a student, my life is pretty simple: attending classes, studying, and sleeping 💤. In my free time, I like to tinker with electronics and smart home devices. To relax, I enjoy listening to music, reading books, and exploring new things.

2024 is here, and during this time, the main content of my blog posts will be related to what I'm studying at school. If there are any mistakes or issues in the content I publish, please feel free to leave a comment~
